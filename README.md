## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

I encountered a few challenges when I was configuring the backend.
I was initially using the given policies for the table. Later, when I realized that it might get complicated for all the CRUD operations, I created my own policies in the SQL editor.
Then it was easy for me to figure out how to query the APIs.
